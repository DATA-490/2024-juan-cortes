# Type of project

This project is a web application developed using Shiny, an R package for building interactive web applications, enabling dynamic data presentation and user interaction.

# Purpose (including intended audience)

The CFO Office Sign in Sheet captures information about walk-in student visits to the Chico State campus Student Services Center(SSC) CalFresh Outreach (CFO) office.

The end goal was to create a Static Report using the Shiny app, data analyses, and final reports to keep track of visits to the office. 

This includes:
-Daily visits
-Weekly visits
-Monthly visits
-Visits by Term
-Types of Assistance
-Repeated Assistance
-How They Heard About CalFresh?

This project intended to help CFO Team by saving time and reducing manual data entry. In turn, it may also help Chico State students by supporting basic needs, which benefit low-income, 
first-generation, and underrepresented students. Lastly, this project may aid stakeholders by delivering insights regarding Federal support.
